# CalendarApp
This app allows a user to create a schedule by storing an event to a timeslot in local storage for reference later. The app was built using html, javascript and stores in local storage, so that the sessions changes are not lost. The app color codes the timeslots (gray for times that are passed, green for times that are current, and yellow for times in the future). Contact Lawrence at lwallac21@gmail.com.
